these alignments are the most up-to-date, however (!) the ITS and ETS use the 
old 04 population codes so must be updated before concatenating with chloroplast!!!

the concatenations in the "2014-07-21_bot14_analyses_2" and "2014-07-21_bot14_analyses_3"
folders are no good due to the 04 codes (and other minor details).
